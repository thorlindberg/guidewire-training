Internal Entity Extension;Created by Guidewire to add application level extensions to platform level entities. Defined with XML file and extension .EIX. Local and read-only inside application.
Extensions;Adds fields to existing classes. Does not create a new subclass of a parent superclass, unlike some OOP languages.
